# minimax_approximation
This program builds an approximation of a continuous function on a given segment using the minimax method.

Approximation in this program is possible with two types of functions: a polynomial and the sum of a polynomial and a hyperbolic cosine. The first is universal, the second is not suitable for every case, but in some cases it demonstrates a slightly better approximation result (less error with the same number of parameters).
The user also selects the function to be approximated, the segment on which the function will be approximated, the number of parameters in the approximation expression.
The program has an option to display the results of intermediate calculations.
